# Revel

Infinite canvas for notes and visual thinking.

## What it does

Everything lives in a single SQLite file. Search uses BM25 ranking. Canvas is infinite with nested spaces you can organize however you want.

**Content:**
- Text notes (plain or formatted)
- Shapes (circles, rectangles, triangles, diamonds, b√©zier curves, graphs)
- Stroke styles (solid/dashed/dotted), fill patterns (solid/hachure/cross-hatch)
- Freehand drawing
- Images, videos (MP4), audio (MP3)

**Connections:**
- Arrows between any elements (curved or straight)
- 4-point attachment system

**Working with stuff:**
- New elements find empty space automatically (spiral search)
- Clone things: fork for independent copies, or link by text/size/position/color
- Layer ordering, rotation, colors
- Add private notes to elements

**Automation:**
- DSL for scripting layouts
- Animations: move, resize, color, fade
- 8 interpolation curves (linear, bezier, ease-in/out, bounce, elastic, back)

**UI:**
- Right-click menus, keyboard shortcuts (`F1` for list)
- Space tree sidebar
- Undo/redo with action log

## Performance

Handles large datasets. Viewport culling means only visible stuff gets rendered. Tested with 10k+ elements.

## AI Integration

Toolbar has AI button. Calls external CLI tools (config in `config/ai_providers.json`) and sends current canvas as DSL context. Binaries need to be in `$PATH`. Settings in gear menu. History saved to database.
